## Doc. Pages

This folder contains the deployable documentation.   
It is built by the `pages.yml` workflow.

You can:

- Add `.html` pages
- Add `.md` pages

You can't:

- Add an `index.md` or `index.html`

The root `README.md` is copied and compiled to `index.html` by the workflow,
which sets it as the homepage.
